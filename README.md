## Features

* **Lightweight**: the core files are less than `20 KB` after minifying and gzip compression.
* **Responsive UI**: all the layout and typography are designed using `rem` and `em` units.
* **Pure CSS Components**: accordion, carousel, dropdown menus, full pages, tooltips, modals.
* **SVG Icons**: generated by JavaScript and can be easily customized and extended.
* **Minimal MVC**: declarative views, DOM-based templating, two-way data binding.
